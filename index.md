## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ assets/images/download.png | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Emely Benavides, and I am a freshman studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. From cats to cars to CAD, my heart belongs to anything with charm, creativity, or whiskers.
In high school, I joined a team of all girls and gender minorities to tackle the FIRST Robotics Competition and empower other girls in engineering, one bolt at a time. I managed a mechanism group to create a cascade lift suited for the year’s game, strategizing and battling alongside several international teams. At Cornell, I am involved with Cornell Electric Vehicles, a team dedicated to creating hyper-efficient autonomous electric vehicles for the Shell Eco-Marathon. I have learned to communicate on a much larger scale, and I am finding my voice with each new CAD and part I produce. 
When I am not tending to my mechanical side, I am solving the NYT Crossword Mini quicker than my friends, drawing new artwork, and playing with my three cats named Pato, Boots, and Catalina. In the future, I hope to make a positive impact, both to give my cats the quality treats they have always dreamed of and to change the engineering world.
