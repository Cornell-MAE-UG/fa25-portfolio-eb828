For our homework assignment, we were asked to draw a design for something to lift a weight on a cantilever beam as high as possible using a linear actuator, 3 joints, and a beam.
I came up with the idea to have the linear actuator normal to the beam carrying the weight, so that the linear actuator can extend the beam vertically as far as possible.

I decided to design a hexagonal scissor lift to complete this assignment, with a horizontal bar AC fixed to the floor with pins, a moving platform, and 4 links connected to make 2 elbows, creating the hexagonal shape. The top of the actuator is pinned to the midpoint of the moving top platform, while the bottom of the actuator is pinned near the midpoint of the bottom, rigid bar. Base = 1.20 m. L(top) = 1.20 m. Scissor links all the same length l.
