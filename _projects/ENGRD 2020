I decided to design a hexagonal scissor lift to complete this assignment, with a horizontal bar AC fixed to the floor with pins, a moving platform, and 4 links connected to make 2 elbows, creating the hexagonal shape. The top of the actuator is pinned to the midpoint of the moving top platform, while the bottom of the actuator is pinned near the midpoint of the bottom, rigid bar. Base = 1.20 m. L(top) = 1.20 m. Scissor links all the same length l. Attached is the physical reasoning and the math taking into account the fact that the beam bends. It contains the design choices to make it physically possible (Outer diameter of the thin-walled hollow circular tubes = 52 mm; wall thickness = 4 mm; length of tube = 1.2 m; cross-sectional area = 6.03 * 10^-4 m^2).
